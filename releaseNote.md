_Note: Actions Runner follows a progressive release policy, so the latest release might not be available to your enterprise, organization, or repository yet.

## Windows x64
We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:
``` powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```

## [Pre-release] Windows arm64
**Warning:** Windows arm64 runners are currently in preview status and use [unofficial versions of nodejs](https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/). They are not intended for production workflows.

We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:
``` powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```
